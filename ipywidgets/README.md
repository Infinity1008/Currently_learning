ipywidgets, also known as jupyter-widgets or simply widgets, are interactive HTML widgets for Jupyter notebooks and the IPython kernel.
Notebooks come alive when interactive widgets are used. Users gain control of their data and can visualize changes in the data.

Learning becomes an immersive, fun experience.

The documentation for Widgets can be found [here](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
